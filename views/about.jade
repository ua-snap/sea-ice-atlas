			| Until now, no tool has existed that allows the simultaneous
			| viewing of multiple sources of visualized &lpar;mapped&rpar; historical sea
			| ice data. The new, web based Historical Sea Ice Atlas is designed
			| to let users view historical sea ice data collected between XX and
			| XX and compiled for display on an interactive map of the seas
			| surrounding northern Alaska.

					strong Uncertainty is not an enemy of science that holds it back&nbsp;
					| &ndash; it is a stimulus that drives it
					| forward.
				p
					| The role of science is to assess the evidence and show
					| which of several possible answers has the most support.
					| Where uncertainties remain, scientists know what to
					| investigate next.
				p
					| We all make decisions in our daily lives that are based
					| on incomplete information. It is helpful to know about
					| uncertainties up front so that we can make informed
					| decisions.

		h2 How to use the atlas
		p
			| Use this atlas to learn how sea ice extent and concentration
			| have changed, from many decades ago to the present time. The atlas
			| is not designed for forecasting or prediction, but can provide
			| useful historical context for future planning efforts.
		p
			strong If you are&nbsp;
			| a resident of a coastal community,
			| someone who hunts or fishes in a marine environment, a member of
			| the shipping or oil &amp; gas industries, in the US Coast guard, a
			| scientist, or otherwise interested in Arctic sea ice data and
			| climate change,&nbsp;
			strong this atlas is for you.

				| Marine resource management decisions are often made through
				| processes that are not based explicitly on resource data &mldr;
				| important weaknesses in current decision-making processes
				| involve two issues that spatial tools can help address: public
				| participation and the availability of data and information.
			p
				| The most pressing management decisions revolve around
				| climate change and the associated changes in environmental
				| conditions coupled with increasing industrial development and
				| consequent human uses of the ocean and near shore
				| environments.
		h2 Data considerations
		p
			| These data represent &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; in time, as well as historical
			| trends in arctic sea ice cover and extent. They are not projections
			| or predictions of future conditions. Things that create uncertainty
			| in data &mdash; especially historical data &mdash; include:
		p
			strong Data collection challenges.&nbsp;
			| Collecting
			| sea ice data is difficult; traveling through or near sea ice can be
			| perilous or impossible for most vessels, and was especially
			| dangerous for historic arctic voyagers. Another hazard is the
			| weather, which is typically capricious and can be severe for
			| observers aboard planes or ships. Historical data collection
			| methods and interpretations of ice concentration often differed
			| from modern protocols, and observers over time have used different
			| types of sensors &lpar;e.g., human observation, radar, satellites&rpar; and
			| instrument calibrations.&nbsp;
			strong
				| All of these add up to
				| inconsistencies in the data.
		p
			strong Data compilation choices.&nbsp;
			| Compiling data
			| always involves a series of choices. Experts do their best to
			| answer questions such as: Which hard copy maps to digitize? How do
			| we interpret this handwriting? How do we fill gaps in the data
			| record? Which time scale is best to use?&nbsp;
			strong
				| These choices lead
				| to uncertainty.
