					| The role of science is to assess evidence and show

					| We all make choices that are based

					| Marine resource management decisions are often made through
					| processes that are not based explicitly on resource data &mldr;
					| important weaknesses in current decision-making processes
					| involve two issues that spatial tools can help address: public
					| participation and the availability of data and information.
				p
					| The most pressing management decisions revolve around
					| climate change and the associated changes in environmental
					| conditions coupled with increasing industrial development and
					| consequent human uses of the ocean and near shore
					| environments.
		p.intro
			| For the first time, you can simultaneously view multiple sources of historical sea
			| ice data from the oceans surrounding northern
			| Alaska. Choose a region and time of interest and inspect a map of data collected 
			| between the mid-1800s and today, 
			| to discover how ice extent and concentration have changed over time.

			strong If you are&nbsp;
			| a resident of a coastal community,
			| someone who hunts or fishes in a marine environment, a member of
			| the shipping or oil + gas industries, in the US Coast guard, a
			| scientist, or otherwise interested in Arctic sea ice data and
			| climate change,&nbsp;
			strong this atlas is for you.
				
		h2 Data considerations
		p
			| These data represent &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; in time, as well as historical
			| trends in arctic sea ice cover and extent. They are not projections
			| or predictions of future conditions. 
			| The atlas is not designed for forecasting or prediction, but can provide
			| useful historical context for future planning efforts.

		h3	Factors that create uncertainty in these data
		p
			strong Data collection challenges.&nbsp;
			| Collecting sea ice data has always been difficult and dangerous work. 
			| Historic interpretations of ice 
			| concentration differed from modern protocols. A wide variety of instrument calibrations 
			| and sensors (human observation, radar, satellites) has been used over time.
			| All add up to data inconsistencies.
		p
			strong Data compilation choices.&nbsp;
			| Compiling data involves choices: Which hard copy maps to digitize? How do
			| we interpret this handwriting? How do we fill gaps in the data
			| record? Which time scale is best to use?
			| These choices lead to uncertainty.
