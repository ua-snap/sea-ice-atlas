		h1 We can plan for the future by studying the past.

		p.intro
			strong If you live in an Alaska coastal community, hunt or fish in a marine environment, 
			| work in shipping or oil and gas, serve with the US Coast Guard, research Arctic ecosystems or are otherwise interested in Arctic sea ice data and
			| climate change,&nbsp;
			strong this atlas is for you.

		p.intro
			| Now you can simultaneously view multiple sources of historical sea
			| ice data from the seas off northern
			| Alaska. Choose a region and time of interest and inspect a map of data collected 
			| between the mid-1800s and today, 
			| to discover how ice extent and concentration have changed over time.

		p.intro
			| The Atlas shows &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo; in time, as well as historical
			| trends in arctic sea ice cover and extent. It is not designed for forecasting or 
			| prediction, but can provide useful historical context for future planning efforts.


		h2
			| Challenges of data collection and interpretation

		p
			| Collecting sea ice data has always been difficult and dangerous work. Interpreting 
			| data is not dangerous, but remains difficult due to differences in historic interpretations of
			| ice concentration from modern protocols as well as instrument calibrations 
			| and sensors (human observation, radar, satellites) over time. 
		p
			| Challenges
			| faced by the Atlas data team included questions such as, Which hard copy maps to digitize? 
			| How do we interpret this handwriting? How do we fill gaps in the data
			| record? Which time scale is best to use?

			a(href='http://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02176_aari_charts/') Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI)&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| Located in St. Petersburg, Russia, AARI produces sea ice charts for safety of navigation in the Eurasian Arctic 
			| and other operational and scientific purposes. Chart coverage focuses on the Northern Sea Route, although later 
			| charts extend into the central Arctic. Charts contain several categories of ice concentration.

			a(href='http://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02169_nordic_sea_ice/') Arctic Climate System Study (ACSYS)&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| An activity of the&nbsp;
			a(href='http://www.wcrp-climate.org/') World Climate Research Program.&nbsp;
			| Includes digitized ice edge positions for the north Atlantic. ACSYS Ice edge information is irregular 
			| in time and space, and is most frequent in the 20th century. When available, ice edge data are provided monthly.
			| The ACSYS study has expanded into the Climate and Cryosphere Project. Visit the&nbsp;
			a(href='http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/resources/historical-ice-chart-archive') ACSYS/CliC Historical Ice Chart Archive 
			| to access all data from this work.

			a(href='http://nsidc.org/data/docs/noaa/g02203-dmi/') Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| These charts provide observed and inferred sea ice extent for each summer month from 1893–1956. Additionally, 
			| Kelly et al. have digitized summer (May-Sept) ice edge information from DMI's monthly maps.
		p.datadesc
			strong Japan Meteorological Agency&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| Monitors sea ice in the Sea of Okhotsk from November to July. Results of monitoring are published for public use.
		p.datadesc
			strong Kelly ice extent grids&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| Digitized ice edge information from monthly maps of Danish Meteorological Institute, May-Sept only. 
			| Kelly digitized only the inferred ice edge and only to a spatial resolution of about 100 km, depending 
			| on the distance of the ice boundary to the pole. He chose not to improve the resolution because of the 
			| low accuracy of the inferred ice edge itself. The eventual plan was for this digitized data to be 
			| incorporated on a one-degree grid into larger sea ice data products as an ice/no ice indicator.

			a(href='http://www.public.navy.mil/fltfor/cnmoc/Pages/navo_home1.aspx') Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO)&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| Oversees the Naval Ice Center (NAVICE), which provides worldwide operational ice analyses for the US military 
			| and government agencies as well as allied nations. Sea ice maps for the Alaskan and Greenland sectors were compiled 
			| into yearbooks for the period 1953–1971. Hard copies of yearbooks are held by the&nbsp;
			a(href='http://nsidc.org/') National Snow and Ice Data Center&nbsp;
			| (NSIDC). In 1972, ice charting was transitioned to the predecessor of the

		p.datadesc
			a(href='http://www.natice.noaa.gov/index.html') Navy-NOAA Joint Ice Center Climatology&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| The National Ice Center began in 1976 as the Joint Ice Center in 1976, comprised of personnel from NOAA 
			| and the US Navy. In 1995, the Joint Ice Center became the National Ice Center as it expanded to include 
			| the US Coast Guard. Coast Guard aircraft, icebreakers, and Marine Safety Offices contribute valuable platforms 
			| for onsite aerial and ship observations, as well as accurate and timely ship and station reports. 
			| Ice charts dating back to 1972 are from predecessor organization. Hard-copy (paper) charts produced by analysts 
			| are subsequently scanned and digitized. Ice charts are based mainly on satellite imagery, supplemented by aircraft, 
			| ship and shore reports.

			a(href='http://nsidc.org/') &nbsp;National Snow and Ice Data Center&nbsp;
			| (NSIDC) by the estate of Bill Dehn are available through a searchable interface. A subset of the charts 
			| have been digitized by the

			a(href='http://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/nsidc0079_bootstrap_seaice.gd.html') NSIDC SMMR/SSMI/AMSR microwavew sensor data &nbsp;&nbsp;
			| Three separate microwave sensors. AMSR-E is the latest sensor, improving upon past microwave radiometers 
			| SSM/I and SMMR. The spatial resolution of AMSR-E data doubles that of Scanning Multichannel Microwave 
			| Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data. Also, AMSR-E combines into one 
			| sensor all the channels that SMMR and SSM/I had individually.

			| (passive microwave) period and are synthesized from various sources. Resolution is 60 nautical miles in space and monthly in time.

			strong Whaling ship logbook data&nbsp;&nbsp;
			| Daily observations taken from logbooks and journals of whaling vessels cruising in the Bering and Chukchi 
			| seas to investigate seaice conditions in this region of the Arctic between 1850 and 1914. 
			| Extracted and digitized daily data on the presence or absence of sea ice from logbook records of annual 
			| cruises in an unbroken record from 1850 to 1914, though there were very few cruises (hence inadequate 
			| data) from 1911 to 1914. Data include more than 52,000 daily observations in an unbroken 65 year record 
			| from 516 cruises. These represent 19% of the total 2,712 cruises.
			| Similar findings are discussed by Eicken et al.&nbsp;
