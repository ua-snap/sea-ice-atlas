				strong FAST ICE
				| is sea ice that forms
				| and remains attached to the shore or to other ice&period;
				| Fast ice may extend a few m to several hundred km
				| from the coast&period; If thicker than about 2 m above sea
				| level&comma; it is called an
				strong
				| ice
				| shelf&period;

				| FIRST-YEAR ICE is sea ice of not more than one
				| winter&apos;s growth&comma; developing from young ice&comma; with a
				| thickness of 30 cm to 2 m&period;

				| A LEAD is a fracture or passageway through ice

				p
				| MULTI-YEAR ICE is old ice 3 m or more thick that
				| has survived at least two summers&apos; melt&period; Hummocks
				| even smoother than in second-year ice&comma; and the ice
				| is almost salt free&period; The color&comma; where snow free&comma; is
				| usually blue&period; The melt pattern consists of large
				| interconnecting irregular puddles and a well
				| developed drainage system&period;
				.item

				p
				| PANCAKE ICE is comprised of predominantly
				| circular pieces of ice from 30 cm&ndash;3 m in diameter
				| and up to 10 cm thick&comma; with raised rims due to the
				| pieces striking against each other&period;

			h2 Measuring sea ice
			p
				strong Area&colon;&nbsp;
				| To estimate ice area&comma; scientists
				| calculate the percentage of sea ice in each pixel&comma; multiply by the
				| pixel area&comma; and total the amounts&period; To estimate ice extent&comma;
				| scientists set a threshold percentage&comma; and count every pixel
				| meeting or exceeding that threshold as &quot;ice-covered&period;&quot; SNAP uses a
				| threshold percentage of 15&percnt; to 100&percnt;&comma; depending on user&rsquor;s
				| context&period;
			p
			strong Concentration&colon;
			| Percentage of an area that is
			| covered with sea ice&period;
			p
			strong Extent&colon;
			| The area of sea with a specified amount
			| of ice&comma; usually 15&percnt;&period; To satellite microwave sensors&comma; surface melt
			| appears to be open water rather than water on top of sea ice&period; So&comma;
			| while reliable for measuring area most of the year&comma; the microwave
			| sensors are prone to underestimating the actual ice concentration
			| and area when the surface is melting&period;
			p
			strong Thickness&colon;
			| Sea ice thickness increases over
			| time&comma; and increases when winds and currents push the ice together&period;
			| The European Space Agency&apos;s
			a(href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryosat-2') Cryosat2
			| satellite
			| was launched in April 2010 on a quest to map the thickness and
			| shape of the Earth&apos;s polar ice cover&period; Its single instrument&mdash;a
			| SAR&sol;Interferometric Radar Altimeter&mdash;can measure the difference
			| between the height of the surface of sea ice and the water in open
			| leads&comma; the &quot;freeboard&quot; of the ice&period; Since 7&sol;8 of the ice is below
			| the waterline&comma; the computation of the thickness is fairly
			| simple&period;
