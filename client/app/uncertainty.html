				<h1>Uncertainty</h1>

				<p>Researchers of Arctic sea ice trends can rely on a fairly
				comprehensive record dating back to 1953, using a combination
				of satellite records, shipping records, and ice charts from
				several countries. The Historical Sea Ice Atlas is a tool for
				visualizing and analyzing sea ice data collected from:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="#">Source 1</a>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="#">Source 2</a>
					</li>

					<li>
						<a href="#">Source 3</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>This tool is offered for use by several audiences, including
				the fishing community, subsistence hunters, shippers, the oil
				&amp; gas industry, the US Coast Guard, scientists, and the
				interested public.</p>

				<h2>Sources of uncertainty in these data</h2>

				<p>These data represent only “snapshots” in time, and
				historical trends in Arctic sea ice cover and extent. They are
				not projections or predictions of future conditions. That said,
				we acknowledge several sources of uncertainty and offer these
				sea ice data for analysis and download with these caveats:</p>

				<p><strong>Data collection challenges.</strong>
				&nbsp;Collecting sea ice data is difficult: traveling through
				or near sea ice can be perilous or impossible for most vessels,
				and was especially dangerous for historic voyagers. Another
				hazard is the weather, which can be severe for observers aboard
				planes or ships. Historical data collection methods and
				interpretations of ice concentration often differed from modern
				protocols, and observers over time have used different types of
				sensors (e.g., radar, satellites) and instrument calibrations.
				All of these add up to inconsistencies in the data.</p>

				<p><strong>Data compilation challenges.</strong>
				&nbsp;Compiling data always involves a series of choices.
				Experts do their best to answer questions such as: Which hard
				copy maps to digitize? How do we interpret this handwriting?
				How do we fill gaps in the data record? Which time scale is
				best to use? These choices lead to uncertainty.</p>

				<h3>It is important to realize that uncertainty is not an enemy
				of science that holds it back – it is a stimulus that drives it
				forward.</h3>

				<p>The role of science is to assess the evidence and show which
				of several possible answers has the most support. Where
				uncertainties remain, scientists know what to investigate next.
				We all make decisions in our daily lives that are based on
				incomplete information. It is helpful to know about
				uncertainties up front so that we can make informed
				decisions.</p>
